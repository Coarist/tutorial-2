# C - Welcome!
This example directory is tailored to using Visual Studio C++ (msvc).

While not required, the `.vcxproj` has been modified to run the StateSmith code generation as part of the build step.

# See .csx File
See [src/LightSm.csx](./src/LightSm.csx).

Discord or github if you have any problems or questions.

Thanks! - Adam
