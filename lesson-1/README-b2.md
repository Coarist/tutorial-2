# Open vscode In Project Repo Root (Or Each Lesson Dir)
Why? Simply because the `.vscode/settings.json` files in each lesson directory (or repo root) are setup to load the StateSmith plugin when you open a drawio file.

Click `Allow` if you trust it. I do :) You can see and even tweak your local copy source.
