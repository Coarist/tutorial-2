# JavaScript - Welcome!
Full disclosure, I'm an embedded C developer that has been messing around with web stuff for years. I can get by, but I'm not very good at it :)

If you like StateSmith and want to help improve it, your help would be very much appreciated! The StateSmith user interface is web based and I need to your help 
to take it to the next level.

Thanks! - Adam
