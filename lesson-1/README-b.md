# draw.io
StateSmith can work with regular draw.io diagrams, but we recommend loading our custom draw.io plugin. It adds some very useful features.

General documentation for draw.io support in StateSmith can be found in the main [StateSmith wiki](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/draw.io).

Documentation specific to the StateSmith plugin can be found in the [plugin repo wiki](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki).

# draw.io offline app or vscode extension?
Both are great, but have different [pros and cons](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki).

A number of new users are having problems with the vscode draw.io extension made by [hediet](https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio) so you may want to consider starting with the offline application. The vscode draw.io extension is very popular, but generally less stable than the draw.io offline app.

# draw.io offline app
If you chose the draw.io offline app, follow [these brief setup instructions](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith-drawio-plugin/wiki/Use-with-app-or-website).

⏭️ You can now skip to [README-c.md](./README-c.md).

# vscode extension
⏭️ If you'd rather use the vscode extension, head to [README-b2.md](./README-b2.md).
